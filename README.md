## Scoring Strategy

The app implements a sophisticated spaced repetition algorithm:

### Score Calculation
- **First correct swipe**: +1 point
- **Consecutive correct**: +2 to +3 points
- **Streak bonus**: +1 point every 3 consecutive correct
- **Incorrect swipes**: -1 to -2 points

### Review Scheduling
- **Negative scores**: Review within hours
- **Low scores (1-3)**: Review within 1-2 days
- **High scores (7+)**: Review within weeks
- **Mastered (11+)**: Review monthly
