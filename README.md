# Chinese-Thai Flashcard App

A React-based flashcard application for learning Chinese vocabulary with Thai translations. Features include text-to-speech pronunciation, card flipping animations, spaced repetition tracking, and multiple deck support.

> **Note**: This repository contains two versions of the flashcard app:
> - **Main branch (this version)**: Vanilla HTML/JS with modular structure - simple, lightweight, works directly in browser
> - **React version**: Modern React app with enhanced features (available in separate commits)

## File Structure

The application has been refactored from a single HTML file into a modular structure:

```
flashcards/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file with external dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # All CSS styles and animations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.js            # Constants, vocabulary data, and access codes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks.js           # Custom React hooks (speech synthesis)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components.js      # React components (Modal, Cards, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js            # Main App component and page routing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # This documentation file
